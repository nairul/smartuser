As a "SmartUser" (haha), I should be able to:

(MVP)-CRUD my SmartUser account containing my username, global password, email address, etc.
(MVP)-CRUD usernames, passwords, and emails for my various apps (Yelp, Uber, Gmail, Battle.net, Steam, etc.)

(Silver)-Have my passwords judged if they're safe/unsafe
(Silver)-Have peace of mind that my passwords are secure! I'm storing them all in one place for Pete's sake!

(Gold)-Easily change passwords for well-known apps (e.g. Gmail, Amazon, Ebay, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) via provided link/directions to that app's security page (e.g. "Amazon.com --> Account & Lists --> Login & Security Settings --> Edit Password")

(Gold)-Recieve an alert (via app & email?) when it's time to change a password and CRUD these alerts 
(e.g. every 30 days for Amazon, every 60 days for Gmail, no alerts for Uber)

(Gold)-Generate safe random OR memorable passwords in case I'm lacking inspiration

(Gold)-Warn me if I'm changing a password to one I've already used for that specific app OR for any app in my Smart User database! 
(e.g. "This password matches a password currently in use by another app. This is an unsafe practice! Consider creating a new password that you've never used before!")

(Gold)-Give SmartUser the password requirements specific to each app so that SmartUser can warn me if I'm creating a password that doesn't meet the requirements. Also, SmartUser should remember these requirements to assist other users storing info for that app!
(e.g. Amazon.com password requires one capital letter and one number) 

(Gold)-Take a "Password Quiz" where I can test my knowledge of safe / unsafe passwords
(e.g. Password: "abcd123" Options: "Safe" or "Unsafe")

(Gold)-Read a short & sweet SmartUser mission statement where I can learn about the developer, Adam Whitehurst, his thoughts on password safety (inlcuding data from http://www.csid.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/CS_PasswordSurvey_FullReport_FINAL.pdf), and why a password manager is a helpful tool

(Gold)-Know my overall password safety score, which looks at all my passwords in the smart user database, and compare it to the average password safety score among all SmartUsers.

(Gold)-Alert me when one of my used apps has reported a security break-in, and suggest that I change my password for that app.    

(Platinum Deluxe Edition)-Purchase & use a physical authenticator manufactured by AdamCorp(tm) that generates a random 6-digit code required to login to the site. The code changes 20 seconds after pressing the button on the physical authenticator.
