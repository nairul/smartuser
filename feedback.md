# Project 2 Evaluation

## Technical Requirements
**3: Excelling**
> The app contains three models and implements user authentication. Nice job putting in Devise. But what's incredibly impressive is that you taught yourself how to work with and successfully implement an API. Seems like you learned a lot. Bravo!

## Creativity and Interface
**3: Excelling**
> The design, layout and color scheme here are very  nice. Also, excellent that this is responsive. I would make the footer sticky though.

## Code Quality
**2: Performing**
> Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues. There is some dead code you're not usiing still in the files.

## Deployment and Functionality
**3: Excelling**
> Application was successfully deployed.

## Planning / Process / Submission
**2: Progressing**
> I love that you detailed the unsolved problems and steps you took to solve. It seems like a lot of this was outside your control, but it's still good to make note of. I would update your readme.md though and remove references to Tunr. I appreciate that for submission, you were writing it for me to understand your approach, but make sure you update it for prospective employers to read. You should also include local installation instructions.
